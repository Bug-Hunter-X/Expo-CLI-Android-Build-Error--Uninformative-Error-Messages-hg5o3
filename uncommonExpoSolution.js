The solution involves a multi-pronged approach to identify the root cause.  First, carefully examine the complete build logs, searching for specific errors beyond the initial, generic message.  Then, inspect the `android/` folder of your project.  Pay close attention to your `android/app/build.gradle` and `android/build.gradle` files, ensuring the configurations and dependencies align correctly.  Address any version conflicts that might be present.  Cleaning and rebuilding the project can sometimes resolve transient issues. Consider running `expo prebuild` before running `expo build:android` to address potential issues in pre-build tasks. If issues persist, try building using `eas build -p android` for detailed build logs.
